# Design menu — make every site look different

The engine is the same every day. **The design is not.** Before building, pick **one option from each menu** below and write the choices into `site/DESIGN.md` (Round 0 in `CLAUDE.md`).

**Uniqueness rule:** compare with the last 3 rows in `docs/SITES-LOG.md`. The new site must differ in **at least 6 of the 8 choices** (look, palette, type pair, nav, hero, section shape, card style, signature moment). Never reuse the same type pair two days in a row. **The hero and the signature moment must not repeat any earlier site's** (check every row of `docs/SITES-LOG.md`), and **the hero must not be a "shape grows to full screen / portal" opening** (window, arch, plate, card or doorway expanding to fill the screen).

**Live demos:** every effect from M38 on, the X6+ transitions and loaders I6–I9 run at **`/lab`** (hidden, noindex); reusable components are in `components/fx/` (sources and licences: `docs/SOURCES.md`).

**Motion:** how each section *moves* is picked separately from `docs/MOTION-MENU.md` (one code per section, no repeats, no plain fades) and written as the Motion map in `site/DESIGN.md`.

Rules: one accent. `muted` must be readable (contrast ≥ 4.5:1 on bg). **Category-reflex check:** if someone could guess the palette from the product category alone (green for organic, gold for luxury), rework it. Cream bg + brass/clay/oxblood accent + espresso text is the most common AI default for premium consumer brands: never two sites in a row. A section can flip to its own colour (e.g. a red band on a white site) — that's a design choice, write it in DESIGN.md.

## 4. Nav style

| # | Nav | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| N1 | Transparent bar → solid on scroll | `Nav.tsx` |
| N2 | Floating centre pill, active link filled | `NavPill.tsx` |
| N3 | Split: links left · logo centre · icons right | custom |
| N4 | Minimal: logo + "Menu" button → full-screen menu with big links | custom |
| N5 | Offer ticker on top + shop bar (search, cart count) | `Ticker.tsx` + custom |
| N6 | Left vertical rail (logo rotated, dots) | custom |
| N7 | Bottom floating dock (appears after hero), can say "You are in: <room>" | `FloorDock.tsx` |
| N8 | **Index tab**: a slim vertical tab on the right edge; opening it slides out a numbered index of sections (like a magazine contents page) · good for: editorial, studios · avoid with: N6 rail | custom |
| N9 | **Command bar**: a centred "Search or jump to…" pill; typing/clicking opens a list of sections and products (keyboard-style) · good for: tech, tools, electronics · avoid with: luxury looks | custom |
| N10 | **Corner logo + progress ring**: logo top-left, a round scroll-progress ring top-right that doubles as the menu button · good for: cinematic, perfume, cars · avoid with: shop-heavy pages (no cart) | custom |
| N11 | **Split bars**: the nav is two short bars, links left and cart right, that slide apart from the centre as you scroll, leaving the middle clear for the hero · good for: fashion, sneakers · avoid with: N3 split | custom |

## 5. Hero layout

| # | Hero | Pattern / asset |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | Full-screen scroll video + timed captions | `FrameHero` + hero video |
| H2 | **Fly-through**: outside the store → through the door → inside | `FrameHero` + fly-through video (AI-VIDEO-PROMPTS G) |
| H3 | Colour switcher: product changes colour + glow | `VariantHero` + cut-out images |
| H4 | Split: text left, product right on a flat colour block, flavour pills | custom (Creamsy) |
| H5 | Giant brand word behind a centred product | custom |
| H6 | Wordmark centred over a looping video, bottom offer strip | custom + video |
| H7 | Editorial collage: 3 images at different sizes + serif headline | custom |
| H8 | Product on a pedestal + spec bar underneath | custom + cut-out |
| H9 | **Word-mask video hero**: a huge brand word is a window; the video plays *inside the letters*, then the letters open to the full video with the scroll | custom (SVG/CSS text mask over `FrameHero`) · good for: drinks, sport, fashion launches · avoid with: thin serif type (letters too narrow) |
| H10 | **Split-reveal hero**: the screen splits along a line (vertical, diagonal or the product's edge) and the two halves slide apart to reveal the product behind | custom (two clipped halves, scrub) · good for: tech, cars, beauty · avoid with: cluttered photos (the split reads as a glitch) |
| H11 | **Zoom-through-object hero**: the camera flies *through* the product (into a bottle neck, through a shoe's eyelet, into a lens) and lands in the next scene. A fly-through, never a frame growing to full screen | `FrameHero` + a "dive" video (AI-VIDEO-PROMPTS) · good for: drinks, optics, perfume, cars · avoid with: products with no opening/depth |
| H12 | **Stacked-cards hero**: 3–5 product cards stacked at angles; they fan out, then the top card settles as the hero | custom (GSAP, M40/M51 helpers) · good for: collections, sneakers, skincare ranges · avoid with: a single hero product |
| H13 | **Circular iris hero**: the product lives in a round viewfinder whose blades open and close like a camera aperture; the circle **stays a circle** (it never grows to full screen) | custom (SVG blades + clip-path) · good for: cameras, watches, eyewear, cosmetics · avoid with: X6 iris on the same page |
| H14 | **Horizontal filmstrip hero**: a strip of frames slides sideways with the scroll; the centre frame is sharp and big, the others small and dim | custom (M41 helpers) · good for: travel, fashion lookbooks, film/events · avoid with: M41 as a later section on the same page |

## 6. Section shape (how sections meet)

S1 straight lines · S2 waves (`WaveDivider shape="wave"`) · S3 soft curves / arches (`curve`, `arch`) · S4 torn paper (`torn`) · S5 rounded panels (each section is an inset rounded card) · S6 tilted (`tilt`) · S7 full-colour bands that alternate · S8 **doorways**: each section opens through a lit doorway that grows to full screen (`DoorwayRooms.tsx`)

More shapes (each: good for · avoid with):
- **S9 letterbox bars**: black bars close in between sections like a film cut · cinematic, cars, perfume · avoid with candy/pastel looks
- **S10 stepped / staircase edges**: sections meet on a stepped edge (3–4 steps) that shifts as you scroll · Swiss, architecture, sport · avoid with soft clay
- **S11 overlapping sheets**: each section is a sheet laid slightly over the last with a soft shadow and a few degrees of rotation · editorial, stationery, food · avoid with brutalist mono
- **S12 pixel/grid edge**: the boundary is a row of squares that breaks up (pairs with X8) · tech, gaming, electronics · avoid with luxury serif looks

## 7. Card style

C1 sharp + thin border (luxury) · C2 rounded + soft shadow · C3 **pop-out** product above a white card (`ProductGrid card="pop"`) · C4 tall photo + text below (`card="photo"`) · C5 glass / blurred · C6 **arch-top** images (saree "Six moods") · C7 polaroid · C8 circles (category bubbles)

More cards (each: good for · avoid with):
- **C9 ticket / stub**: a perforated edge, a tear-off stub with the price, serial number · events, cinema, travel, drops · avoid with luxury jewellery
- **C10 spec sheet**: a mono label grid (name, size, weight, price) under a cut-out product, hairline rules · tech, sneakers, brutalist mono · avoid with soft clay
- **C11 clay tile**: thick rounded tile with a soft inner shadow, product sitting *in* it · kids, snacks, wellness · avoid with dark luxury
- **C12 chrome bezel**: a card framed by a thin metallic gradient border with a moving reflection (M49) · tech, audio, EVs, fragrance · avoid with warm editorial

## 8. Signature moment (pick ONE hero moment + max 2 supporting)

| Moment | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Scroll-scrubbed video | `FrameHero` |
| Exploded parts with labelled callouts | `FrameScrub` + exploded video |
| 360° product spin with specs | `FrameScrub` |
| Colour switch | `VariantHero` |
| Curved drifting gallery | `CurvedGallery` |
| Pinned sideways gallery | `HorizontalGallery` |
| Expanding strips | `ExpandingPanels` |
| Product showcase that swaps by itself | `ProductShowcase` |
| Word-by-word statement | `Statement` |
| Endless big-word marquee | `Marquee` |
| Stacking cards (each card pins and the next slides over) | custom |
| Image reveal through big text (text mask) | custom |
| Walk-through rooms: doorway reveal, the whole page takes each room's light + a dock that says which room you're in | `DoorwayRooms.tsx` + `FloorDock.tsx` |
| Bento whose tiles light up in turn (border beam + spotlight) | `BeamBento.tsx` |
| WebGL picture moments (liquid reveal, displacement swap, flowmap, zoom blur, RGB shift): see MOTION-MENU M38/M55/M56/M66/M67 and `/lab` | `components/fx/gl.tsx` |
| Particle word / morphing words as the brand moment | `components/fx/text.tsx` (M45), `more.tsx` (M59) |

## 9. Section ideas for the rest of the page

Shop-style (clients picture their business): `ProductGrid` (row / grid) · `Bento` offers · category circles · "Shop the look" · new arrivals · bestsellers · `Ticker` offers · store locations · `Faq` · newsletter band · `PolaroidWall` / `Testimonials` · `WordmarkFooter` / `Footer`

Cinematic: `Statement` · `Stats` · `Split` story · `Parallax` band · `Features` · `Cta`

Aim for **9–12 sections**: 1 hero + ~3 cinematic + ~5 shop-style + footer.

## 9b. Travelling / floating object (site pattern, codes F1–F8)

One product stays on screen and **travels across the sections** (spins in the hero, flies to the left while text appears on the right, turns sideways, lands in a shop card, settles in the closing). Pick **one** carrier (F1, F3 or F6) + optional F7/F8. Live: `/lab/travel/f1 · f3 · f6` (+ f3t, f3r to compare 3D engines). Motion details and rules: MOTION-MENU section K.

| Code | Pattern | Looks like | Good for | Avoid with |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **Waypoint travel (PNG)** | a transparent cut-out (front, 3/4, side, back crossfaded) glides between anchor spots | any packaged product (cans, bottles, jars, shoes); the lightest option | photo-heavy sections behind it (the cut-out edge shows) |
| F2 | **Pinned 3D turn** | the 3D product pinned centre, turning/tilting while specs scroll past | tech, watches, audio, sneakers ("spec stage") | a pinned hero video in the same stretch |
| F3 | **3D travel** | the 3D model moves, turns and scales from section to section | drinks, cosmetics, gadgets with a good model | thin/complex models (hair, fabric): use F1 |
| F4 | **Camera fly-through** | the camera circles the product and dives into it along a path | cars, architecture, perfume, launch films | busy shop sections right after (needs a calm landing) |
| F5 | **Fold / assemble** | the product's parts come together (or a box unfolds) as you scroll | packaging, furniture, gadgets, gift boxes | products with no parts/layers |
| F6 | **Simple 3D orbit** | `<model-viewer>` turning the product with the scroll in one section | a quick 3D moment with almost no code | sites already heavy (≈ +336 KB) |
| F7 | **Floating ingredients** | 5–12 small cut-outs (fruit, ice, leaves) float around the product at 3 depths | drinks, food, skincare, perfume notes | minimal luxury looks (feels busy) |
| F8 | **Land in UI** | the product flies into the cart pill / card on "Add to cart", the count bumps | every shop site (a filmed "add to cart" moment) | sites with no cart |

## 10. Loader / intro

I1 letters rise then wipe (engine default) · I2 brand pattern fills the screen, then zooms out (e.g. paisley for sarees) · I3 counter 0 → 100 · I4 logo drawn as a line · I5 circle expands from the centre

More loaders (live in `/lab`; each: good for · avoid with):
- **I6 pixel transition**: a grid of cells covers the screen in a random wave, the page swaps in, cells clear from the centre (`components/fx/more.tsx` PixelLoader) · tech, gaming, electronics · avoid with L1/L11 luxury
- **I7 rapid layers**: 3–4 colour/photo layers wipe in fast, ending on the hero title (M63, RapidLayers) · fashion drops, sport, launches · avoid with slow calm looks
- **I8 particle word**: dots gather into the brand name, then blow outward as the page opens (M45, ParticleText) · tech, beauty, events · avoid with busy photo heroes
- **I9 shutter/iris**: camera aperture blades close on the logo and open onto the hero · cameras, eyewear, cinematic · avoid with H13 iris hero (same idea twice)
- **I10 preloader-to-hero overlap**: a counter capped at 1.6 s that waits for fonts + the hero image, then its plate wipes off (clip-path) while the hero title is already staggering in (≥ 0.3 s overlap, never a gap) · any site · avoid with a long brand intro

---

## How "restyle a pattern" works

Patterns in `components/patterns/` are **starting points**. For each one used, copy it into `site/components/`, rename it for the brand (e.g. `FlavourCards.tsx`) and change at least **3** of: layout proportions, type scale/case, card shape, colours used, spacing, image shape, the motion. Two sites using `ProductGrid` must not look alike.
