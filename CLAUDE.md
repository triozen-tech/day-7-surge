# Showreel Kit — playbook for Claude Code

> **Our kit is the source of truth.** DESIGN-MENU, MOTION-MENU, LESSONS.md, SITES-LOG uniqueness and the brief always win over any skill's style advice. Skills are helpers for HOW to build, not WHAT it should look like.
>
> Inside this kit, always use our project skills `caption`, `cover-check` and our reel workflow (`record-check`, `npm run reel`) — never the global `caption-and-hashtags`, `cover-thumbnail-brief`, `reel-builder` or `reel-scripter`.
>
> The `animation-principles` and `motion-system` skills apply ONLY to small UI motion (buttons, hovers, menus, cart). Scroll-driven, cinematic and video-scrub motion follows MOTION-MENU and is exempt from their duration and easing limits.

This repo builds **one showcase website per day**. The team films the laptop screen with a phone held **vertically (9:16 Instagram reel)** while the site scrolls itself, and posts it to win clients. Two things matter most:

1. **Every site must look like a different designer made it.** New layout, nav, typography, cards and page flow every day. Only the engine underneath stays the same.
2. It must look **premium and real**: a cinematic moment (scroll video, product spin, colour switch) **plus** real-business sections (products, prices, offers, categories), so a client can picture their own brand.

Desktop (1440×900 and 1920×1080) is the priority. **Reels are recorded only on the laptop** (`?record=1` at 1440×900); there are no phone recordings. Phones must still work (clients open the link on their phone): they are checked with **screenshots only** (`npm run phone-shots`, 360×640 and 390×844). See "Checks every round" below.

**Before anything else, every day and every round: read `docs/LESSONS.md`** (rules learned on earlier days). At the end of a day, add the day's new lessons to it.

**Motion is always on (permanent rule).** Never honour the OS reduce-motion setting; only `?static=1` disables motion. `prefersReducedMotion()` in `lib/gsap.ts` is the ONLY switch (true only with `?static`); no `prefers-reduced-motion` media query or `matchMedia` anywhere else (`npm run check` fails on it). Why: that setting is ON by default on many Windows machines and turned the live sites into flat static pages.

## How the kit is organised

| Folder | What | Change per site? |
|---|---|---|
| `components/engine/` | Loader, SmoothScroll (Lenis ↔ GSAP), Animations (data attributes), RecordMode, Cursor, useFramePlayer | **No** |
| `lib/` | gsap setup, frame loading, loader tracker, site types | **No** |
| `components/patterns/` | Library of ready sections (stock + patterns from the reference reels). **Starting points, not templates.** See them live at `/patterns` | No: copy them, then restyle |
| `components/sections/` | **Section layouts**: 90 full designed sections, one per `docs/SECTION-MENU.md` code (HR, FT, BN, PS, ST, SY, GL, SP, PR, FQ, CT, NL, FO), shared blocks in `kit.tsx`, motion by code in `motion.ts`. See them live at `/lab/sections` | No: copy the layout into `site/components/`, then restyle |
| `components/ui/` | SplitText (GSAP SplitText, masked lines), Magnetic, Button, TiltCard | Rarely |
| `components/fx/` | **Effect library** (M38+ motions, X6+ transitions, I6 loader, collected effects): text, layout, WebGL (`gl.tsx`), more. Live at **`/lab`** (hidden, noindex). **`fx/travel/`**: travelling product object F1–F8 (driver + PNG / OGL 3D / three / R3F / model-viewer layers), live at **`/lab/travel/f1 · f3 · f6`** | No: import or copy |
| `lib/gsap.ts` · `lib/gl.ts` · `lib/film.ts` | GSAP + **all plugins registered in one place** (`loadPlugin()` for the big ones) · OGL WebGL helper (lazy) · scroll-video player (video time, blending, subject-fit) + `components/patterns/FilmPin.tsx` | No |
| `scripts/` | `make_frames.py` (video → frames by video time), `reel.mjs` (record + freeze checks, phone shots), `cover-check.py`, `check-site.mjs`, `archive.mjs` | No |
| `.claude/skills/` | `new-site` + ours: `video-frames`, `record-check`, `phone-check`, `cover-check`, `flow-prompts`, `caption`, `archive-day` + official GSAP skills (`gsap-*`) | Add, don't edit |
| `site/` | **Everything about today's site**: `DESIGN.md`, `site.ts` (meta + theme), `fonts.ts`, `site.css`, `content.ts`, `components/`, `Page.tsx` | **Yes, rewritten every day** |
| `archive/` | Finished sites (`npm run archive -- <name>`, `npm run restore -- <name>`). **Local only, not in git** | — |
| `docs/` | `LESSONS.md` (**read first**), `DESIGN-MENU.md` (the variety engine), `MOTION-MENU.md` (a motion code for every section), `SOURCES.md` (open-source effects + licences), `SITES-LOG.md` (**local only, not in git**), AI prompts, filming guide | Update the log + lessons |

**The repo shows only the current project.** Each day lives in its own folder (a copy of the kit), so old sites stay safe there. In git there is only: today's site (`site/`) **and its assets** (`raw/` Flow images + Veo videos, `public/images/<slug>/`, `public/frames/<slug>-*`, `cover.jpg`), the engine, the pattern library and the kit docs. No other brand names or images. `.gitignore` keeps `archive/`, `docs/SITES-LOG.md`, `recordings/`, `*.mov`, final reel videos, venvs, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.env*` and `.DS_Store` out. **Any single asset over 50 MB goes through Git LFS** (`.gitattributes`; `npm run assets` checks sizes and warns over 100 MB).

`app/page.tsx` renders the engine + `site/Page.tsx`. `app/layout.tsx` reads `site/site.ts` (colours → CSS variables) and imports `site/fonts.ts` + `site/site.css`.

**Engine features you get for free**
- Scroll videos are image sequences: `npm run frames -- raw/<video>.mp4 frames/<slug>-<name>` → `/frames/<slug>-<name>`. Use them with `FrameHero` / `FrameScrub` / `useFramePlayer`.
- Animations by data attribute (`components/engine/Animations.tsx`): `data-reveal`, `data-reveal="stagger"`, `data-split` (with `<SplitText>`), `data-parallax="0.15"`, `data-zoom`, `data-count="850"`.
- `data-cursor="View"` on anything shows a label on the custom cursor.
- Theme tokens as Tailwind colours: `bg-bg`, `bg-surface`, `text-fg`, `text-muted`, `text-accent`, `bg-accent`, `text-accent-fg`, `border-line`; classes `font-display`, `eyebrow`, `container-x`, `section-y`, `btn btn-solid|btn-outline`. Override or add styles in `site/site.css`.
- `?static=1` = no motion (layout review) · `?record=1` = auto-scroll for filming.
- Record timeline: put `data-record-time` / `data-record-hold` (+ `-align`, `-offset`, `-mobile`) on sections so `?record=1` gives every section fixed seconds, identical on laptop and phone; `&at=HH:MM:SS` starts two devices together. See `docs/RECORDING.md`.

## Building a new site — Round 0 + 5 rounds

**Every round starts by re-reading `docs/LESSONS.md`.** Stop after **every** round, tell the user in plain simple language what to check, and wait for their "ok".

### Round 0 — Design direction (no code yet)
0. **Read `docs/LESSONS.md`.**
1. **Clear the previous site's assets**: delete the old site's raw files, images and frames (`raw/*`, `public/images/<old-slug>/`, `public/frames/<old-slug>-*`, `cover.jpg`) and any demo assets (they are tracked in git now), so only the new site's assets exist. The old site stays safe in its own day folder (and in the local `archive/`).
2. **Read the brief** (brand, what it sells, audience, mood, assets in `raw/` and `public/images/`).
3. **Read `docs/SITES-LOG.md`** (what the last sites looked like), **`docs/DESIGN-MENU.md`**, **`docs/SECTION-MENU.md`** and **`docs/MOTION-MENU.md`**, and open **`/lab/sections`** (every layout, live) and **`/lab`** (the M38+ effects).
4. **Pick one option from each menu**: look, palette, type pair, nav, hero, section shape, card style, signature moment, loader. Follow the uniqueness rule (≥ 6 of 8 different from each of the last 3 sites; never the same type pair two days in a row; the hero and signature never repeat any earlier site's, see step 6).
5. **Plan 9–12 sections**: 1 hero + ~3 cinematic + ~5 shop-style + footer. For each: name, **its SECTION-MENU layout code** (HR, FT, BN, PS, ST, SY, GL, SP, PR, FQ, CT, NL, FO), the pattern/layout it starts from, and *how it will be restyled*. **No layout code used twice on the site, and none that any of the last 3 sites used** (SITES-LOG → Layouts column).
6. **Plan the motion**: give every section (loader, nav and footer included) **one motion code** from `docs/MOTION-MENU.md` (each SECTION-MENU entry lists the motion codes that suit its layout). **No code used twice** on the site, and **"just fade in" is not allowed** as a section's motion. **The hero and signature must not repeat ANY earlier site's hero or signature**: check every row of `docs/SITES-LOG.md` (Hero, Signature and Motion columns), not just yesterday's. **The hero must not be a "shape grows to full screen / portal" opening** (a window, arch, plate, card or doorway that expands to fill the screen). Also note the transitions between sections (X codes) and the planned details (hover, cursor).
7. **Write `site/DESIGN.md`** with: the choices + a one-line reason each, the section plan, the **Motion map** table (section → **layout code** → motion code → how it plays here → phone → record mode; template at the end of MOTION-MENU.md), and the assets still needed (with prompts from `docs/AI-VIDEO-PROMPTS.md`). Reasons describe *this* site, never old ones.
   - Put the "different from the last sites" comparison table in **`docs/SITES-LOG.md` only** (under "Uniqueness checks"), not in `DESIGN.md`, so old project names never appear in the repo. `DESIGN.md` just says "8 of 8 different, see the sites log".
8. **Ask the user**: approve the direction and the Motion map, and generate any missing assets.

### Round 1 — Structure (build it)
1. **Save the old site first**: `npm run archive -- <day-NN-slug>` (if not already saved), then clear `site/` except `DESIGN.md`.
2. **Assets**: put images in `public/images/<slug>/`. For every scroll video use the **`video-frames`** skill (`site/frames.json` + `npm run film-frames`: by video time, watermark painted out, ≤ 12 MB desktop / ≤ 6 MB phone; play with `lib/film.ts` + `FilmPin`). The older `npm run frames -- raw/<video>.mp4 frames/<slug>-<name>` still works for simple evenly spaced frames. Cut-out product images (transparent PNG/WebP) for pop cards / colour switcher. Asset prompts: **`flow-prompts`** skill.
3. **Fonts**: `npm i` the chosen pair, import them in `site/fonts.ts`.
4. **Write** `site/site.ts` (meta, theme, record), `site/site.css` (brand-specific styles: buttons, eyebrow, special effects), `site/content.ts` (all text/data), `site/components/*` and `site/Page.tsx`.
   - Copy each pattern you use into `site/components/` under a brand-specific name and **restyle it** (see the end of DESIGN-MENU.md). Import **at most 3 patterns unchanged** from `components/patterns/`.
   - Build the nav and footer for this site too (copy `Nav`, `NavPill`, `Footer` or `WordmarkFooter` and restyle, or make new ones).
   - Never edit `components/engine/` or `components/patterns/` for one site's needs; copy instead.
   - Build the markup the Motion map needs (masks, strips, split text, SVG paths) so motion can be added later without changing the layout. Everything shows in its final state with `?static=1`.
5. **Copy**: short, premium headlines (2–6 words per line). Real-sounding product names; sample prices in the brand's currency (₹ for Indian brands).
6. `npm run check` and `npm run build` must pass.
7. **Phone screenshots** (`npm run phone-shots`, see "Checks every round"): fix anything cut off or overlapping first.
8. **Ask the user to review with motion off**: `http://localhost:3000/?static=1` on the laptop (+ the phone contact sheets). They check: every section shows, text is readable, nothing is cut or overlapping, it looks like the DESIGN.md direction and **not like the previous site**.

### Round 2 — Big motion (loader, hero, signature, pinned sections)
1. **Loader**: shows the brand, then reveals the site with its Motion map code.
2. **Hero**: build its motion; tune the scroll length / switch timing; captions must have time to be read.
3. **Signature moment**: make it great.
4. **Every pinned or scroll-scrubbed section** in the Motion map (M10, M11, M25, M27–M30 …): build it and tune its scroll length.
5. **Auto-motion for filming**: nobody touches the mouse on camera, so anything that needs hover/click must also play by itself while on screen (like `ExpandingPanels`, `ProductShowcase`, `VariantHero`).
6. **Motion map check** (see below) for the sections done this round.
7. **Checks every round** (below): the 1440 reel must PASS and the phone screenshots must be clean. Send the user the 1440 reel; fix anything jumpy, too fast, empty-looking or overlapping they find.

### Round 3 — Section motion + transitions
1. **Every other section** gets its own Motion map code (reveals, text, numbers, groups, lines, ambient). Plain `data-reveal` may support, never replace, the code.
2. **Transitions between sections** (X codes in MOTION-MENU.md): how each section hands over to the next, so the page flows as one film.
3. Supporting motion stays calmer than the signature; one main thing moves at a time.
4. **Motion map check** for the whole page.
5. **Checks every round** (below), then send the user the 1440 reel.

### Round 4 — Details + phone pass
1. **Details**: hover states, cursor labels (`data-cursor`), magnetic buttons, link/button micro-interactions, count bumps. Each one that matters on camera also plays once by itself.
2. **Phone pass with screenshots** (`npm run phone-shots`: every section at 360×640 and 390×844, pinned sections at start / middle / end): every section uses its phone fallback from the Motion map; the main subject (product, can, person) is **fully visible and nothing overlaps it**; menu opens/closes; no sideways page scroll; nothing cut off; text ≥ 12px. Videos are placed by where the subject is in the frame (a measured box + the free area around the text), never a fixed crop, so it works on every phone size.
3. **Motion map check** on the 1440 reel + the phone screenshots.
4. **Checks every round** (below), then send the user the 1440 reel (+ the phone contact sheets if anything changed on phones).

### Round 5 — Polish, performance, archive (ready to film)
1. Readability (small text ≥ 12px, contrast), headings not breaking badly at 1440px.
2. **Performance**: frames < 15 MB per video, images WebP and sized, no layout jumps, particles/canvas pause off screen, smooth scrolling at 1440 and 1920.
3. `?static=1` still shows every section in its final state.
4. No console errors; `npm run build` passes.
5. Set `meta.record.duration` so the **whole page scrolls in 25–40 s** (reel length). Test: `npm run build && npm start` → `npm run reel` (or watch `http://localhost:3000/?record=1`).
6. **Final checks**: `npm run reel -- <day-NN-slug>-final` (PASS), `npm run phone-shots` (clean at 360 and 390), `npm run check`. Send the user the 1440 reel.
7. **Add a row to `docs/SITES-LOG.md`** (including the Motion column: loader · hero · signature codes, and the **Layouts column**: every section's layout code), **add the day's new lessons to `docs/LESSONS.md`**, and run `npm run archive -- <day-NN-slug>` (skill: **`archive-day`**, which also commits and pushes the day's repo when asked).
8. **Repo check**: run `npm run assets` (nothing over 50 MB outside LFS) and `git ls-files`, and confirm the repo only contains the current site's assets (`raw/`, frames, images, cover), the engine, the pattern library and the kit docs: no other brand names (`git grep -il <old names>`) and no other site's images. Report the file list (grouped by folder) and the total size (`git ls-files -z | xargs -0 du -ch | tail -1`).
9. Report back in plain simple language: the section list, anything skipped, and the filming command (see `docs/RECORDING.md`).

### Checks every round (Rounds 1–5)
Every round starts by re-reading `docs/LESSONS.md`. Skills: **`record-check`**, **`phone-check`** (and `cover-check` for the reel cover). Run against the production server (`npm run build && npm start`):
1. **`npm run reel -- <day-NN-slug>-r<round>`**: records `?record=1` at **1440×900 only**, trims it to the page (first paint → end of the auto-scroll), runs **freezedetect** (n=0.002, d=0.4 s) and **frame-diff** (no stretch ≥ 0.3 s without change) and prints PASS / FAIL. It must PASS. If it reports < ~50 fps captured, the machine is busy: re-run (don't "fix" the site for a recorder hiccup). Look at any flagged spot before changing anything. (Round 1 has no motion yet: skip the reel.)
2. **`npm run phone-shots`**: one screenshot of every section at **360×640 and 390×844** → `recordings/phone-shots/` (+ one contact sheet per size). Look at every shot: the main subject fully visible, nothing on top of it, nothing cut off.
3. Fix every problem **before** saying the round is done. No phone recordings, and the checks run on the 1440 recording only.

### Motion map check (end of Rounds 2, 3 and 4)
Go through the Motion map in `site/DESIGN.md` section by section and open the page (normal scroll and the 1440 reel; the phone screenshots for phone layout). For each section confirm: its main move **is** the planned code (not a plain fade), it plays without hover/click, and `?static=1` shows its final state. Fix every section that doesn't match (or, if a better motion was chosen, update the map, still with no code used twice). Report the result as a short table: section · code · ✅ / fixed.

## House style

- Big headings, generous spacing, few words. Never cram.
- One accent colour per site (a section may flip to a colour band on purpose).
- All images in one site share one mood and colour grade.
- Motion is smooth and confident, never bouncy or messy.
- **Prices**: sample prices are fine (it's a concept). Always keep a footer note like "Concept website by <studio>".
- No fake phone numbers, addresses of real people, or legal text.
- Real brand names are OK for concept sites, but never use the brand's real logo file or copy their real website; the design is ours.

## Adding to the pattern library

If you build something on a site that would be useful again (a new nav, hero, card or section), **also** add a clean, generic version to `components/patterns/`, show it on `app/patterns/page.tsx`, and add it to `docs/DESIGN-MENU.md`.

- Pattern demos on `/patterns` use **plain colour placeholders** (the SVG `photo()` / `cutout()` helpers in `app/patterns/page.tsx`) or the current site's images, **never an old site's**. Placeholders are preferred: they never break when a day's images are removed.
- Pattern code and comments stay generic: no brand names (write "first built for a running-shoe site", not the brand).

## Commands

- `npm run dev` / `npm run build && npm start` (use production for filming)
- `npm run frames -- <video> <folder> [--zoom 1.2] [--max 160] [--start s] [--end s] [--reverse]`
- `npm run check`: all images/frames used in `site/` exist
- `npm run assets`: asset sizes (raw, frames, images, cover) + biggest file; fails if a file over 50 MB is not in Git LFS, warns over 100 MB
- `npm run reel [-- <name>]`: record `?record=1` at 1440×900 → `recordings/<name>.mp4` + freezedetect + frame-diff (PASS / FAIL)
- `npm run phone-shots`: screenshots of every section at 360×640 and 390×844 → `recordings/phone-shots/`
- `npm run film-frames [clip]`: video → scroll frames by video time (`site/frames.json`, skill `video-frames`)
- `npm run cover-check -- <cover.jpg> [--fit]`: Instagram safe areas on a 9:16 cover
- `npm run cutout -- <folder> [out]`: transparent PNGs with rembg + BiRefNet (install once: `pip3 install "rembg[cpu,cli]"`)
- `npm run glb -- <in.glb> [out.glb] [--ogl]`: compress a 3D model (gltf-transform; ≤ 3 MB; `--ogl` for OGL / model-viewer)
- `PAGE=/lab npm run reel -- lab` · `PAGE=/lab npm run phone-shots`: check other pages (long pages: `SECS=180`)
- `npm run archive -- <name>` / `npm run restore -- <name>`
- `/patterns`: pattern catalogue · `/lab/travel/<f1|f3|f3t|f3r|f6>`: travelling object demos · `/lab`: every M38+ motion, X6+ transition and collected effect, live (hidden, noindex) · `?static=1`: no motion · `?record=1`: auto-scroll (`&duration=30` or `&speed=200`)
